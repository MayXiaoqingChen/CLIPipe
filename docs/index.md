# CLIPipe

CLIPipe is an integrated pipeline for analyzing CLIP sequencing data. It provides all the commands needed to process CLIP-seq data, and it could identify sites of protein-RNA interactions on RNA from CLIP-seq data.

CLIPipe's input is the raw FASTQ file of CLIP-seq, and its main output is BED files with identified cross-linked sites.

Several other analyses are also included in CLIPipe that provide insights into the properties of protein-RNA interaction.

The CLIPipe workflow consists of:

-   Pre-processing function:
    -   Quality control, adapter removal, low-quality reads filtering, duplicates collapsing, and barcode removal of the raw CLIP-seq data.
-   Alignment function:
    -   Mapping pre-processed data to reference genome using bowtie, bwa, and novoalign
-   Peak calling function:
    -   Binding peak enrichment using Piranha, CTK, PureCLIP, iCLIPro, iCount, JAMM, PeakRanger, and clipcontext
-   Motif discovery function:
    -   Motif discovery of the binding regions using HOMER, PhyloGibbs, MEME, GraphProt, DREME and STREME
